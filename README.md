### Introduction
As a group, we decided to really go for it in the group project and tackle an amazon ecommerce clone.  We wanted to challenge ourselves in design, functionality and hoped to tackle a few bonus items beyond the MVP requirements.  

### User Stories

- As a user I can sign up for an account
- As a user I can login to the clone

- As a user I can use the search bar to find products
- As a user I can add a product to the cart
- As a user I can add multiple products to the cart
- As a user I can update the cart of items
- As a user I delete items from my cart
